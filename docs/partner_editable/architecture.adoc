image:./image1.png[image,width=643,height=432]

As shown in Figure 1, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* An architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An AWS Managed Active Directory environment.*
* 
* In the public subnets:

* Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* A Remote Desktop Gateway instance in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound remote desktop (RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*

* In the private subnets:

* An EC2 instance running Microsoft Windows to serve as an offline Root CA
* An EC2 instance running Microsoft Windows to serve as a Subordinate CA

*** The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.

1.  Run Root CA installation and configuration
2.  Begin Subordinate CA setup
3.  Get domain credentials from Secrets Manager
4.  Join Active Directory Domain
5.  Add DNS Records for Root CA and Subordinate CA
6.  Subordinate CA puts CA request (csr) into Parameter Store
7.  Root CA gets CA request from Parameter Store & Approves
8.  Root CA puts all certificates and CRLs into Parameter Store
9.  Subordinate CA gets all certificates from Parameter Store
10. Subordinate CA uses dspublish and installs certificate for ADCS Activation
11. Subordinate CA removes domain credentials from Secrets Manager
