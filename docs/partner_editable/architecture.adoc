Deploying this Quick Start for a new virtual private cloud (VPC) with default parameters builds the following {partner-product-short-name} environment in the AWS Cloud.

image::../images/image1.png[Architecture1,width=100%,height=100%]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* An architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* An AWS Directory Service environment.*

* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway) instance in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*

* In the private subnets:
** In Availability Zone 1, an EC2 instance running Windows to serve as an offline root CA.
** In Availability Zone 2, an EC2 instance running Windows to serve as a subordinate CA.
* AWS Secrets Manager to securely store credentials.
* AWS Systems Manager to automate the CA deployment process and store the generated certificates.
* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles providing enabling the EC2 instances and Systems Manager automation documents to perform their tasks.

[.small]#* The template that deploys the Quick Start into an existing VPC skips the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC configuration.#

== The AD CS deployment process

The Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) environment deployed by this Quick Start includes an offline root CA and an online subordinate CA. The AWS Systems Manager automation document created by this Quick Start automates the steps below; when the process is complete, the root CA will have generated a domain root certificate and powered off, and the subordinate CA will be available to sign certificate requests for the domain.

Deploying the AD CS Quick Start, as shown in <<architecture2>>, automates the following steps: 

// SSM stands for AWS Systems Manager, we may need to clarify that earlier in the document. The steps below are all automated and require no manual intervention from the customer; I've clarified that in the above sentence.

1.  Install and configure the root CA.
2.  Install and configure the subordinate CA.
3.  Get the domain credentials from Secrets Manager.
4.  Join the Active Directory domain.
5.  Add the Domain Name System (DNS) records for the root CA and subordinate CA.
6.  The subordinate CA puts a certificate-signing request into Parameter Store.
7.  The root CA gets a CA request from Parameter Store and approves it.
8.  The root CA puts all certificates and certificate-revocation lists into Parameter Store.
9.  The subordinate CA gets all certificates from Parameter Store.
10. (Not shown) The subordinate CA uses `dspublish` to install the certificate and activate AD CS.
11. (Not shown) The subordinate CA removes the domain credentials from Secrets Manager.
