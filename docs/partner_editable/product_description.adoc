Windows environments use digital certificates to secure multiple types of connections: Microsoft Active Directory LDAPS* lookups, Internet Information Services (IIS) HTTPS connections, Exchange Server communications, Windows Server Update Services (WSUS), and so on. A public key infrastructure (PKI) creates, manages, distributes, stores, and revokes these digital certificates.

With a Windows-hosted PKI in an AWS account, you can maintain your own certificates. This capability helps you reduce insecure, unsigned network traffic. To deploy a PKI environment on Windows, you install and configure CA roles on one or more Windows servers.

This Quick Start deploys both a root CA and a subordinate CA. The root CA acts as the primary certification authority for an Active Directory forest. The certificates generated by the root CA sign the server and application certificates issued by the subordinate CA. The Quick Start automatically generates an initial root certificate and powers off the root CA's Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. This instance serves as an offline root CA. By keeping the root CA offline except when a new root certificate needs to be generated, this deployment helps ensure the integrity of the root certificate.

//TODO Dave, Here, we say that the root CA stays offline "except when a new root certificate needs to be generated." Later (under "Security"), we say that the root CA is intended to remain offline "until the subordinate CA certificate needs to be renewed." Please swap in a consistent statement in both places. Thank you!
