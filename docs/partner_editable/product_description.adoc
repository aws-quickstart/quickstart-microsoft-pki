//TODO Dave, Please expand this description for readers who are coming to this content for the first time. We'll reuse this description for the landing page overview. You could model it on the AD DS overview: https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/active-directory-ds/. (1) Add a few sentences that mention Microsoft PKI, public keys, and public-key infrastructure in generalâ€”set the context for why we created this Quick Start. (2) Weave in a mention of the overall categories/concerns that this QS addresses (such as security, identity and compliance). (3) Mention the AWS Managed Microsoft AD environment (possibly with a link to this page: https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/). (4) Include the benefits of using the software on AWS. (5) Provide details on usage scenarios.

CA roles are Windows roles that are available to be installed on Windows Server. A root CA acts as the primary certificate authority for an Active Directory forest. The certificates generated by the root CA are used for signing the server and application certificates issued by the subordinate CA.

This Quick Start deploys both a root CA and a subordinate CA. It automatically generates an initial root certificate and powers off the root CA's Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance. This instance serves as an offline root CA. By keeping the root CA offline except when a new root certificate needs to be generated, this deployment helps ensure the integrity of the root certificate.
