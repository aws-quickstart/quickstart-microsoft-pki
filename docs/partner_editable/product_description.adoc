//TODO Dave, Please expand this description for readers who are coming to this content for the first time. We'll reuse this description for the landing page overview. (1) Add a few sentences at the beginning that mention Microsoft PKI, public keys, and public-key infrastructure in generalâ€”set the context for why we created this Quick Start. (2) Weave in a mention of the overall categories/concerns that this QS addresses (such as security, identity and compliance). (3) Consider also mentioning how AWS Managed Microsoft AD fits in (possibly with a link to this page: https://aws.amazon.com/directoryservice/active-directory/) since that's an important part of the architecture. (4) Include the benefits of using the software on AWS, and provide details on usage scenarios.

CA roles are Windows roles that are available to be installed on Windows Server. A root CA acts as the primary certificate authority for an Active Directory forest; the certificates generated by the root CA are used for signing server and application certificates issued by the subordinate CA.

This Quick Start deploys both a root CA and a subordinate CA. An initial root certificate is automatically generated and the root CA EC2 instance is powered off, serving in the future as an offline root CA. Keeping the root CA offline except when a new root certificate needs to be generated ensures the integrity of the root certificate.
