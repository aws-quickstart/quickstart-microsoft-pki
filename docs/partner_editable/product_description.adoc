Certificate Authority (CA) roles are Windows roles that are available to be installed on Windows Server. A Root CA acts as the primary certificate authority for an Active Directory forest; the certificates generated by the Root CA are used for signing server and application certificates issued by the Subordinate CA.

This Quick Start deploys both a Root CA and a Subordinate CA. An initial root certificate is automatically generated and the Root CA EC2 instance is powered off, serving in the future as an offline root CA. Keeping the Root CA offline except when a new root certificate needs to be generated ensures the integrity of the root certificate.
