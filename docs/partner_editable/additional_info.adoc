== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

This Quick Start migrates pertinent folders and files related to the certificate services to an additional EBS volume [ D:\ ]. Back up the {partner-product-short-name} deployment, including the private key and the current certificate database.

== Security

After this Quick Start deploys the root CA server and generates the root certificate, the root CA server is powered off and is intended to remain offline until the subordinate CA certificate needs to be renewed.

Domain administrator credentials are stored in AWS Secrets Manager and consumed by the subordinate CA for domain joining, installing certificate services and adding the required DNS records. When these tasks are completed, the domain administrator credentials are removed from AWS Secrets Manager.
